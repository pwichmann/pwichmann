## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pascal. 

- Visit my personal page [here](https://pwichmann.github.io/) (<-- working on this one as you read this).
- Find my interactive book on Deep Learning with Vector Graphics from 2021 [here](https://pwichmann.github.io/deep-learning-with-vector-graphics-book/).
- If you are here for my PhD research on extracting supply chain networks from natural language text, look [here](https://github.com/pwichmann/phd_thesis). The startup commercialising the idea of my PhD research called Versed AI has been acquired by Exiger.
